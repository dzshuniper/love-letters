# Love Letters

## About ##

This is an anniversary gift to my partner, inspired by the work of Christopher Strachey. It is a JavaScript implementation of the love letters program that Strachey implemented using the Ferranti Mark I at the Manchester University Computing department in 1953-1954. As a geeky Mancunian in a same-gender relationship, I felt a connection to Strachey, a gay man writing love letters with computers in Manchester.
